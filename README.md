Flexbox Webpage Project
This is my work on The Odin Project's Flexbox landing page assignment. I built this to practice modern CSS layout techniques, focusing specifically on mastering Flexbox.
The project shows how to structure a complete webpage using Flexbox, including a header, content sections, and footer.
